# 🔧 Homepage Spacing Fixes - Refresh Button Area

## ❌ Issue Identified

Excessive spacing under the "Refresh Data" button on the homepage was creating an unbalanced layout and poor user experience.

## 🎯 Root Cause

The spacing issues were caused by:

1. **Large bottom margin** in the text section of `domain-chart-preview.tsx`
2. **Excessive section spacing** in the main homepage component
3. **Commented-out text elements** that were still affecting layout

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Fixed Domain Chart Preview Component** (`frontend/components/sections/home/domain-chart-preview.tsx`)

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 order-1 lg:order-2 lg:max-w-[70%] mx-auto lg:mx-0 mb-4 sm:mb-6 lg:mb-8">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 order-1 lg:order-2 lg:max-w-[70%] mx-auto lg:mx-0 mb-2">
```

**Changes:**
- Reduced bottom margin from `mb-4 sm:mb-6 lg:mb-8` to `mb-2`
- Simplified responsive spacing to a single value
- Removed excessive spacing under the refresh button

### **2. Fixed Main Homepage Component** (`frontend/components/sections/home/index.tsx`)

**Domain Chart Preview Section:**
```tsx
// Before
<div className="mb-6 sm:mb-8 md:mb-12 lg:mb-16">

// After  
<div className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 md:mb-8 lg:mb-12">
```

**Domain Data Preview Section:**
```tsx
// Before
<div className="mb-6 sm:mb-8 md:mb-12 lg:mb-16">

// After
<div className="mb-4 sm:mb-6 md:mb-8 lg:mb-12">
```

**Final Page Spacing:**
```tsx
// Before
<div className="my-4 sm:my-6 md:my-8 lg:my-12" />

// After
<div className="my-2 sm:my-4 md:my-6 lg:my-8" />
```
