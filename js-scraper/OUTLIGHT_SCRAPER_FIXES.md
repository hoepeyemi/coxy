# Outlight.fun Telegram Scraper - Fixes and Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Puppeteer Compatibility Issue**
**Problem**: `page.waitForTimeout is not a function` error
- **Cause**: The `waitForTimeout` method was deprecated in newer versions of Puppeteer
- **Fix**: Replaced `page.waitForTimeout(5000)` with `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000))`
- **Location**: `outlight-scraper.mjs` line 76

### 2. **No Channels Found on Outlight.fun**
**Problem**: Outlight.fun homepage doesn't contain direct Telegram channel links
- **Cause**: The website structure may not include visible Telegram links
- **Fix**: Added fallback channel discovery system with common memecoin channels
- **Implementation**: Added `getFallbackChannels()` method with popular channels

## ✅ Improvements Made

### 1. **Fallback Channel System**
Added a comprehensive fallback system that includes:
- `memecoin_hunters` - General memecoin community
- `solana_memes` - Solana-specific memecoin channel
- `pumpfun_official` - Pump.fun official channel
- `bonk_official` - BONK token official channel
- `crypto_bags` - General crypto community

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Graceful handling when no channels are found on Outlight.fun
- Automatic fallback to known channels for testing
- Better error messages and logging

### 3. **Improved Testing**
- Updated test scripts to handle fallback channels
- Added dedicated Telegram scraping test script
- Better test coverage for edge cases

### 4. **Better User Experience**
- Clear messaging when fallback channels are used
- Detailed logging of channel sources
- Progress indicators for each step

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Fallback Channel Discovery**
```javascript
async getFallbackChannels() {
  // Returns array of known memecoin Telegram channels
  // Used when Outlight.fun doesn't have direct links
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Test Suite**
- `test-telegram-scraping.mjs` - Tests message scraping with known channels
- Updated `test-outlight-scraper.mjs` - Handles fallback scenarios
- Better error reporting and debugging

### 3. **Improved Main Pipeline**
- Automatic fallback when no channels found
- Better channel deduplication
- Enhanced logging and progress tracking
